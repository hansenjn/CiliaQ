# ![CiliaQ](https://github.com/hansenjn/CiliaQ/blob/master/Webfiles/20200618%20CiliaQ%20Logo%20Small.png?raw=true) R Scripts
Here we provide R markdown scripts that help you to convolve data from multiple CiliaQ results files:

* The script [CiliaQ_Simple_Results_Merger.Rmd](https://github.com/hansenjn/CiliaQ/blob/master/R%20Scripts/CiliaQ_Simple_Results_Merger.Rmd) allows to load results files from CQl.txt files that are all stored in the same folder and outputs excel files for different parameters with tables merging all the different files in the folder. For more instructions see the notes in the file.
* An R template for a more complex analysis, of many CiliaQ files in a file system and producing several plots, has been released by Sebastian Rassmann here: https://github.com/sRassmann/ciliaQ-output-joinR
