To test and try CiliaQ, we here provide images from the data-sets presented in the [CiliaQ publication](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.28.317065):
- [Analysis of a confocal 3D image stack showing Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts stimulated with Smoothened agonist (SAG)](https://github.com/hansenjn/CiliaQ/tree/master/Examples/MEF%20SAG-treated).

*More data sets will follow soon...*
