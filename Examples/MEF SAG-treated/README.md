# ![CiliaQ](https://github.com/hansenjn/CiliaQ/blob/master/Webfiles/20200618%20CiliaQ%20Logo%20Small.png?raw=true) [Examples](https://github.com/hansenjn/CiliaQ/Examples)
To test and try CiliaQ, we here provide images from the data-sets presented in the [CiliaQ publication](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.28.317065).

## Example: Confocal microscopy image of cultured cells
Here you find an example confocal 3D image ("MEF_SAG-treated_Example.tif") of Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs) stimulated 24 h prior to fixation with 1 ÂµM Smoothened Agonist (SAG) and stained with DAPI (channel 1), a Smoothened antibody to label Smoothened translocation to the primary cilium (channel 2), and an ARL13B antibody to label cilia (channel 3). The image was analyzed using CiliaQ Preparator, revealing the output files with ending "_CQP", and, next, using CiliaQ, revealing the other output files. We skipped editing with CiliaQ Editor because all cilia were correctly segmented and, thus, there was no need for manual correction.

Note: The .tif-file presented was cropped from a larger image to reduce the file size - original image below.
